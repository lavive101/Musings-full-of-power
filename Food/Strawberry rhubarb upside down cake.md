Strawberries and rhubarb make a dreamy upside-down cake combo—and you can absolutely prep them with minimal sugar. Here’s how to do it:

  

  

  

  

Strawberry-Rhubarb Upside-Down Prep (Low Sugar)

  

  

  

You’ll need:

  

  

- 1–1½ cups sliced strawberries
- 1–1½ cups chopped rhubarb
- 1–2 tablespoons butter or ghee (for the pan bottom)
- 1–2 tablespoons maple syrup, honey, or coconut sugar (optional—skip if you want it truly no added sugar)
- Pinch of salt
- ½ tsp vanilla (optional)
- Tiny squeeze of lemon (optional—brightens it up)

  

  

  

  

  

Step-by-step:

  

  

1. Prepare the pan:  
    

- Rub or melt the butter/ghee into the bottom of your pan.
- Drizzle or sprinkle your chosen sweetener on top, if using.

3.   
    
4. Slice the fruit:  
    

- Strawberries: remove tops and slice in halves or thick slices.
- Rhubarb: wash and chop into small (½ inch) pieces.

6.   
    
7. Optional pre-cook for tender fruit:  
    

- If you want the fruit super soft, you can lightly sauté the rhubarb in a skillet with a teaspoon of butter and a splash of water for 2–3 minutes, just to soften it a little. Add strawberries in the last 30 seconds so they don’t get mushy. This is optional—depends on your texture preference.

9.   
    
10. Arrange in pan:  
    

- Spread the rhubarb and strawberries evenly over the butter/sweetener layer in the pan. Try to make it pretty—it’ll be the top once flipped!

12.   
    
13. Pour your cake batter gently on top.

  

  

  

  

  

Tips for Low-Sugar Flavor:

  

  

- Rhubarb is very tart, so the strawberries are your natural sweetener here.
- A pinch of salt and dash of vanilla can enhance the fruit flavor without adding sugar.
- Baking caramelizes the fruit naturally, especially with even a little bit of butter

2. In a large bowl, whisk together:
