My parents should see my story and realize that they are on the wrong side. 
They should see how much Hans has hurt me and understand their own dynamic. 
They should feel shaken and like they need me and that they need to find a way to work with me. 
I should completely forget about them and live my life. 
I should focus on community living and see what I can come up with. 
How do you have community shares on a property? Rent out a space. What does it have to do with insurance? Legalities of tiny homes and toilets. 
I should completely shove the ideas of moving back to the farm away for this year. 
I need to clear extra stuff. I should cut out
The things that weigh me down. Even all the homeschool stuff that is too young.
