Heads up: If you’re a former 23andMe customer, now’s the time to delete your account.

The company just filed for bankruptcy.

That means your genetic data - the most personal data you have - could be sold.

Here’s how to delete it: 

To ask them to destroy your DNA sample:

-> Go to “Settings” > “Preferences”

-> Withdraw any previous consent for your sample to be stored or used in research

-> You can also revoke consent for future research participation under “Research and Product Consents”

Note: If you ask them to destroy your DNA sample, be sure and do that *before* you delete you account.

To delete your account and all its data:

1. Log into your account

2. Go to your profile > “Settings”

3. Scroll to “23andMe Data” > click “View”

4. Select “Delete Data”

5. Click “Permanently delete data”

6. Follow the prompts to confirm

My office, along with others, has been investigating 23andMe for over a year after a major data breach exposed personal information.

We’re watching how they handle your genetic data now that they’ve entered bankruptcy - but you shouldn’t wait.

Delete your data. Today.
