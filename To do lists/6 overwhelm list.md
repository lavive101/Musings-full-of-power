There are too many things in my closet. When I look inside I can’t quickly decide what to wear. Also I don’t really have any outfits. Some things are too big on me and some things are too small and some kid like and some grown up. It’s not easy to pull together an outfit. 

Crafts. So many options. I have to keep what I’m wanting in my mind. But I also like to have a million project ideas and so I like the security of knowing that I have the materials needed when the whim strikes. 

I am celebrating speaking up to Svetlana. I need to regroup and reown things. When I am “in control”, I don’t always say all my motives or something.  It makes sense to filter those. They are the great truth. That is hard to bear right then. The real truth. 

I don’t want to do laundry anymore because there is to much stuff in all the putting away things. 

To hard to choose which books to read

I don’t care about any of this stuff.
