I’ve opened up too much. 
I can no longer hide with myself. 
I need my needs to be met. 
I cannot go back to isolation. 
My needs will not shut up. 

I need meaningful connection

Anyone need more
Meaningful connection? 

Come play authentic relating games with us. 
We like to connect and games include things like sentence stems and structures that help us connect despite not knowing each other at all. The games are guides to support us in a practicing being in connection as humans together. 

Connection: the warm glow feeling of looking into another’s eyes and realizing you are being seen just as you are and seeing others just as they are. And just that one moment feels pretty great. :)
