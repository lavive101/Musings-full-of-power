Join us on Feb 7th for Exploring Love: A Greek Perspective, an evening where ancient wisdom meets the heart of authentic connection. Think of it like a "gym for your heart" as we flex our curiosity, empathy, and communication muscles through games inspired by the Greeksâ€™ seven types of love: Ã‰ros (romantic), Philia (friendship), StorgÄ“ (familial), AgÃ¡pÄ“ (unconditional), Ludus (playful), Pragma (enduring), and Philautia (self-love).

Whether youâ€™re an authentic relating pro or have never heard of AR, youâ€™re warmly invited to join. Connection Collective is about creating meaningful interactions through simple, engaging exercises that invite laughter, trust, and deep conversation in a relaxed, welcoming space.

Expect guided games that help you uncover your unique relationship with love, from its playful aspects to its enduring presence. Youâ€™ll leave with fresh insights, meaningful memories, and perhaps even a deeper appreciation for the many facets of love.

Come as you are, bring a friend or two, and step into a space where authenticity and joy come alive.

Below is an expert from a post by fellow Authentic Relating enthusiast, Riley Dow . He reflects on his first experience with AR, and his words have resonated deeply with me: 

"Authentic Relating isnâ€™t about performing vulnerability. Itâ€™s about radically reclaiming our wholeness through relationship." 

This sentiment has stayed with me, especially after my focus circle in Damian's class today, where the circled person felt an internal pressure to keep digging for and revealing their internal experience.

Here the expert from the post ðŸŒ¹

" Iâ€™ve learned that we only receive the fundamental human needs of being seen, felt, understood, and accepted when we are willing to let ourselves be known.

And that takes courage.

It takes the courage to reveal, to slow down, to notice, and to share whatâ€™s real even when itâ€™s messy or unclear.

Authentic Relating isnâ€™t about performing vulnerability.
Itâ€™s about radically reclaiming our wholeness through relationship.

In the presence of our own love, our truth becomes more welcome.
In the presence of truth, the weight of our own judgment softens and can transform.

When we realize that "our own love" is equally true from within our selves as when held and channeled through "another" we enter evolutionary relationship.

When we realize we donâ€™t have to exile parts of ourselves to belongâ€”
Thatâ€™s when real belonging begins.

If this speaks to you, Iâ€™d love to hear:
Whatâ€™s one moment where you felt truly seen in your wholeness?"
