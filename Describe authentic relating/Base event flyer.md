Authentic Relating Connection 
An hour of invented social structures used to give rise to new conversations. 

A made-up way to guide a short conversation so it feels deeper, more interesting, and a bit like an adventure. 

We will use simple, structured relating activities to experiment with how to see ourselves and others in a new way. 

At this gathering, there will be less small talk and more talk about what is real in short chunks. 

Weâ€™ll slow down, stay curious, and create a space that feels full of permission, playfulness, and expression. 

* those with social anxiety welcome


What to expect:

- A mix of guided talking + listening games
- Encouragement and support  to honor your own self discovery and relationship to relating
- Find: self-awareness and human connection 
- Opportunity to express yourself or your feelings right as they are - in a container. 
- come as you are
