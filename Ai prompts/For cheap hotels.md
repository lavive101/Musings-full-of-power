STOP OVERPAYING FOR HOTELS

I used ChatGPT to stay in $1,000/night hotels for under $100.
No points. No loyalty. Just unhinged prompt sorcery.

These 7 hacks are how luxury travelers actually cheat the system:

1. Location Switch Prompt

“Find luxury hotels in [city] that drop in price when booked using an IP from [low-cost country].”
Yes, booking from another country can save you 50%+.

2. Last-Minute Luxury Hack

“Find 5-star hotels in [city] that slash rates due to last-minute cancellations — prioritize same-day check-in.”

3. Ask me for 3 

4. Celebration Strategy

“Write an email to a hotel requesting a complimentary upgrade — as a couple celebrating an anniversary.”
You’d be shocked how often it works.

5. Hidden Gems Filter

“Find boutique 5-star hotels near [city] not listed on Booking(dot)com or Expedia — include contact info for direct booking.”

6. Low Season Scanner

“List weeks in 2024 where luxury hotels in [location] are historically 60%+ cheaper due to off-peak demand.”

7. The Ultimate Deal Finder

“Generate a ChatGPT prompt that finds the cheapest 5-star hotel near [location], with free Wi-Fi, breakfast, and late checkout.”
