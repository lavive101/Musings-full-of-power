The most important thing for me is to feel landed here on earth connected as a human. I believe that humans are supposed to have fewer interactions and less complications or connection with earth. More connection with feeding ourselves more connection with creativity and more connection to each other and working together We’ve lost a chance to have the joy of being human and I just wanna do whatever I can to start creating spaces where we can be human in my authentic relating games, I practice being human slowing down with each other and just being aware of ourselves there’s some interaction there’s some learning about each other. I really like to have us Low demand low requirement safe spaces as possible that the word safest problematic so that needs to be worded so that safe just means a chance to slow down and to really notice yourself and have permission to get regulated if you need to get regular like find a way to get regulated in that might be asking for help, but most people are used to becoming regulated in and out all day long if someone has a lot of trauma and regulates easily than this particular environment might be more difficult for you so I invite you to be very cautious with yourself as you come into that environment and be really aware of what you personally can handle I can do my best to notice when there could be upset or dysregulation in the room but also, I really want to empower all of you. We’re really here to slow down be present to who we are and it’s not usually as dark as all of that.
