I have a deep love for the earth that holds us. 
I listen to rhythms of earth as the core of my daily rhythm. 

I feel connected to the earth that nourishes us. 

As long as I can remember, I have been interested in gatherings and community. And as I’ve gotten older, I realize how important authenticity (really being myself) is to me. To be myself as I am, surrounded by caring, known, others is the starting point for play, security, true living. 

I also know that community and relationship are not a destination but a practice. 

My interest and curiosity is piqued when I can slow down enough to really see another. 

I appreciate my work in the following roles:
Small group experience facilitator 
Moderator
Relational Embodiment Coach
  

I guide people into experiences that invite presence, curiosity, and emotional truth. I believe that every interaction—when met with care—has the potential to be transformative. 

My style is warm, spacious, and gently structured, creating environments where people feel safe enough to take small risks and true enough to be fully seen.

  

My work is grounded in a commitment to relational integrity. I’m currently training with the Right Use of Power Institute to deepen my ability to navigate power dynamics with skill, humility, and heart. This lens supports my desire to hold space that is not only authentic but also ethical, consent-based, and restorative.

  

I’m also a researcher and philosopher. I’m am researching how the details of life itself are relational—lived in everyday conversations and present-moment interactions. I am gathering stories of community, food, care, and presence and weaving a vision of life that honors connection over control, and slowness over striving.

  

In daily life, you’ll often find me gardening, cooking slow meals, practicing connection, practicing community or wandering in the woods listening. I’m nourished by simplicity, intimacy, and

Hi, I’m [Your Name]—a facilitator, relational embodiment coach, and community weaver.

  

I have a deep love for the earth that holds and nourishes us. I listen to the rhythms of the land as the core of my daily rhythm—whether I’m gardening, cooking slow meals, or wandering in the woods listening to the wind in the trees. I’m nourished by simplicity, intimacy, and the quiet joy of being with what is.

  

As long as I can remember, I’ve been drawn to gatherings and the magic that happens when people come together. Over time, I’ve come to see how central authenticity is to that magic—being fully myself, as I am, in the company of others who care and know me. That’s where I feel the ground of play, security, and true living.

  

I’ve learned that community and relationship are not destinations, but living practices—tended moment by moment. My curiosity is sparked when I slow down enough to really see another person. That space of seeing and being seen is where transformation lives.

  

In my work, I serve in roles like:

  

- Small group experience facilitator
- Relational embodiment coach
- Moderator and community guide

Relational integrity is a core commitment in all I do. I’m currently training with the Right Use of Power Institute, deepening my ability to navigate power dynamics with skill, humility, and heart. This lens supports my desire to hold space that is not only authentic, but also ethical, consent-based, and restorative.

  

I’m also a researcher and philosopher at heart. I’m exploring how the fabric of life is relational—woven through everyday conversations and present-moment interactions.

Absolutely—here’s a shorter, simpler version that keeps your core values and unique tone, while removing redundancy:

  

  

  

Hi, I’m [Your Name]—a facilitator, moderator, relational embodiment coach, and community weaver.

I’m grounded by a deep love for the natural world and the rhythms of daily life—gardening, cooking, wandering in the woods, and being in honest connection. I’m nourished by simplicity, intimacy, and the kind of presence that brings us back to ourselves and each other.

Since I was young, I’ve been drawn to gatherings and the promise of a caring community. As I’ve grown, authenticity has become essential: being myself, as I am, in caring company. I believe community isn’t a destination—it’s a practice of showing up, seeing, and being seen.

I bring this sense of practice into everything I do. I am not in relationships - I like to think of it more like practicing relationship in every conversation I have. Each conversation is a practice in attuning, accepting, appreciating and responding to the people in my life. 

  
In my work, I guide small groups and individuals into spaces of presence, curiosity, and emotional truth. My facilitation style is warm, gently structured.

  
I’m also exploring how life itself is relational—lived in everyday conversations, shared meals, and moments of care. My work and writing reflect a vision of nonhierarchical models and slowness over striving.

  

  

Thanks, that helps clarify. Here’s a more grounded and cohesive version of your About Me for a webpage—simple, clear, and with fewer buzzwords:

  

  

  

Hi, I’m [Your Name].

I’m a facilitator, relational coach, and community weaver. My work centers on building an environment or inquiry around connecting more deeply to the relationships around us. These relationships are in each moment of the day. We have a relationship with ourselves, our own bodies, with the people around us, and with the living world.

I have always been drawn to gatherings. Over the years, I have come to see how much we need spaces where we can be fully ourselves—honest, messy, curious, tender—and still feel subtly held by each other. I notice a shortage of these spaces. It is my passion to rebuild them in an open, non demanding way. 

  

I guide small groups and individuals through conversations and experiences that invite presence and emotional honesty. Whether I’m hosting a circle, coaching someone through a tough moment, or holding space for a group, my aim is the same: to create a sense of safety and trust, where something real can happen.

  

My approach is shaped by the natural world. I take my cues from the seasons, the soil, and the quiet wisdom of slowness. Much of my daily life is spent in rhythm with the land—gardening, cooking, walking in the woods, or sharing meals with neighbors. These simple acts remind me what matters: care, attention, and relationship.

  

I’m also writing and gathering stories about how we live together—how food, conversation, and everyday gestures can carry a vision of life that values connection over control, and depth over speed.

  

If you’re longing for spaces where you can show up as you are, I’d love to be in conversation.
