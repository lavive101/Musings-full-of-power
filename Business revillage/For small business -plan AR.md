Getting to know you. 
A recent sweet memory of me and my child 
One thing I really appreciate about Greenwood Tree 
One thing I hope my child takes away from this experience at Greenwood Tree 

One small thing I look forward to each day


Walk around quietly, noticing self and other, you can have a soft gaze on the floor. If you have a little bit of interest, you could start to look around, but let’s save that for later for now. Just noticed you’re noticing of yourself and other.

Take the time to notice how you feel when you’re further from others notice your own breath notice the energy in your body. If you can feel it notice the feel of the ground under your feet noticed the temperature of the air as it goes across your skin, what’s it like just to walk amongst Your fellow parents I feel yourself and feel other.

Another simple game we often use is one that we use for a check-in. This will be where two people pair off and the first person shares something that’s important to you. It doesn’t matter what you share to something you feel like talking about right now doesn’t need to be profound. It doesn’t need to be really deep. You can choose what you wanna share. I mean it might be something that you’re struggling with. It might be something you’re looking forward to. I just wanna really give you let you be at choice it might be nice to really be seen as how you are right now for that make up pastor level of comfort and maybe you wanna pick something else so the first person just shares for three minutes about something that’s on their mind lately and the second person reflects back with a heard. Try not to add anything just reflect back what you heard the time slot for that is two minutes so if you run out of things to say that’s OK And then after you do some, you do the reflective listening. The first person has a chance to say what the person got right or wrong about what they did and then at the end the listener just answers the sentence stem something I know more about you now is and then we’ll take Four minutes to talk about just among your in your pair what it was like to share and be seen

The Garou game is anyone up for playing the guru game in this game one person sits in the center and they are the guru and we all agree to suspend judgment and just believe that this person who’s the guru has infinite wisdom so no matter what you say it’s right so then the rest of us just ask that person questions What will happen next year maybe and the guru draws and it’s all new on they’re all knowing and just answers

Maybe a game about something magical that happened in childhood and amplifying the feeling of magic
