I might lose friends and followers for this, and that’s okay. What I’m about to say about Tantra in Ubud, and what I believe women truly need, won’t be popular. But it needs to be said…

They told you that the shiver in your belly
was divine awakening.
That the man who couldn’t hold your heart
but could hold your hips
was somehow a teacher.

They told you to open.
To breathe deeper.
To make eye contact for seven minutes
and call it intimacy.
To become a goddess
who needs nothing
but gives everything.

And here you are.
Wide open.
Well-practiced in pleasure.
Well-versed in saying yes.
Surrounded by other women
who sing to their yonis
but sleep alone.
Who lead cacao ceremonies
then cry themselves to sleep.
Who can scream their truth into the jungle
but can’t ask a man,
Will you stay?

You were taught how to open
but not how to protect yourself.
You were taught how to feel
but not how to discern.
You were taught how to give
but not how to say,
No, you can’t touch me
unless you can carry what’s inside me.

And the men,
so many of them smiling, spiritual, seductive,
they play the game well.
They quote Rumi before they undress you.
They call you their goddess
then disappear into another woman’s arms the next day
and call it flow.

They’ve mastered the art of seeming safe
without ever offering safety.
They say “I want to be present with your heart”
but never ask what it needs.
They get the sacred without the sacrifice,
the feminine without the responsibility,
the temple without the vows.

And so many women,
so many gifted, radiant women,
end up hurt
but are told to call it expansion.

But you know.
Somewhere in your belly, you know.
This isn’t the depth you came for.
This isn’t the union you ache for.
This isn’t power.
It’s performance.

Tantra didn’t fail you.
Truth did.

You were sold performance as embodiment.
You were told openness was always the answer.
You were shown men in linen pants and deep eye gazes
but never men who stay,
who choose,
who carry the weight of their word.

And that’s why so many tantra teachers are still alone.
That’s why the workshops are full of pleasure
but empty of partnership.
That’s why the most devotional women
are still waiting
to be met.

So here it is.

You are allowed to want a man
who is strong enough to commit.
You are allowed to want a relationship
with roots.
You are allowed to say
I don’t want to share you.
You are allowed to close
to the ones who won’t choose you.

Because sacred isn’t a ceremony.
It’s a man who keeps his word.
It’s a love that builds something.
It’s depth with direction.
It’s presence with protection.
It’s your body, heart, and soul
all being held
in one pair of hands
that don’t let go.
