REASONS WOMEN GET ATTACHED TO A MAN AFTER INTERCOURSE 

1. WOMEN SEE SXX AS AN AFFAIRS (BUT MEN SEES IT AS AN EXPERIENCE 
Men just want to experience how it is to sleep with a person of your kind of body component, big bre@st, big backside, tall or short etc
But for a woman, she opens her leg because she already have  A REASON(s) TO GIVE YOU SXX but a man only need a space, no reason, no love, he just want to release and walk away, no emotion attached.

A lady looks at the man immediately after sxx with the mindset that they are for an affairs or something serious and you see the man throw away his face. He might not come back again, pick your call or look for you. 

Most especially when he has taken the lady for shopping, to restaurants, cinema etc before they had sxx, he feels that the lady has been paid for given him sxx.

That's where the genZ generation missed it, they feel sxx on a first date is okay and that's why.....
* Most ladies don't care about love again, their heart has been broken many times that they go for money and not love
* Most ladies don't care about their body again, either it's been exposed, tattooed, pierced, sxx video, or
kn!fed to increase it. They just want money 

2. WOMEN NAIVELY BELIEVE WHAT THEY HEAR MEN TELL THEM. 
The way to a woman's heart is through her ears. For a man to sleep with a woman, he says what the woman wants to hear: 

‚ÄúYou are the most beautiful woman I‚Äôve ever met. You are so smart, focused and intelligent.‚Äù
This way, she doesn‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs taking her for a fool. And whoops, she falls for his trap! 

Men feels, until you know how to lie, you can't date any lady.
Actually, frankly speaking, if a man tells a lady the truth about him and how much he loves her, 98% ladies will reject him but if the same man lies, he sleeps and run away.

Most times they run away because they don't want all their lies to be revealed. If you stay too long, the game will cast.
A man stay when he tells you the truth and you accepted him. He has no reason to abandon you. So if you see a man running away, he had lied and doesn't want it exposed üòÇ ü§£. 

3.  WOMEN BELIEVE IN LOVE. 
Outside marriage, men are just cheaters (irresponsible men). For men, there‚Äôs no love gained or lost. After sex, a man walks away with zero feelings. The game is over. She‚Äôs left confused and wounded. Women don‚Äôt easily slow down after intimacy. 

That's why the best way for a woman to know if he loves you is NEVER GIVE HIM SXX UNTIL YOU ARE MARRIED. Only the genuine will stay. 

Also, the best way to test a woman love is, NEVER GIVE HER MONEY OR MATERIAL UNTIL YOU ARE MARRIED. Only the genuine one will stay

Women believed in love because the way to show love is GIVING. So as soon as a man start giving them stuff, a lady start developing feelings for him, forgetting that, a man can give you money just to taste you and walk away. That's when they get confused that how can he spend so much just to release and leave without coming back

4. WOMEN ARE MORE EMOTIONAL BY NATURE
I get irritated by anyone that compares a man with a woman because a woman is made with emotions but a man is not.

The woman‚Äôs body releases volumes of oxytocin during intimacy. This is the hormone responsible for bonding. She naturally gets emotionally attached to the man she slept with. And the more time he sleeps with her, the more attached she becomes. 

Having sxx means a lot to a woman, she does it with all her mind, emotions and being, but it means nothing to a man. He just want to release, that's how he is created. 

5.  WOMEN ARE NURTURERS BY NATURE. 
Women unconsciously nurture relationships the same way they nurture babies. Women foster and nourish whatever comes their way including grown up men. 

Anything you give to a woman, she nurtures it, and increase it for you
* Give her $perm, she nurtures it and give you a baby
* Give her groceries (food stuff & condiments), she gives you a meal.
* Give her an apartment, she gives you a home with warmth and care.
* Give her unfaithfulness & excuses, she will give you a load of problems üòÇ ü§£ 

6.  SXX FOR WOMEN IS AN ACT OF SUBMISSION. 
Sxx happens in the heart of a woman before it happens in the physical. She would have thought about it over and over again, if she want sxx or not. Then she conclude to submit her body to the man, with reasons best known to her.

That's why when a lady is visiting her boyfriend, she already shaved because she already conclude that, there will be sxx that day. She wears a sxxxy undies, she appear beautiful and more relaxed as the man torched her.

The man be like, let's go home together, she won't argue, she follows you today after many try, Please "man up", you didn't convince her to go home, she convinced herself to submit to you

When a woman sleeps with a man, she totally trusts him.
In sxx, a woman surrenders her life, will and body to the man to do with her as he wishes. That‚Äôs why women get broken to pieces when relationships break down.

7. WOMEN SEE SXX AS A FORCE TO BIND EACH OTHER AS ONE
If you want to have sxx with a woman, she feels you are asking for a bonding, that's why she kept thinking if she really want to bond with you. Most of them get confused after the man never showed up again, she will be like, was there no bonding?, Didn't he not enjoy me?. 

- He never came to bond or enjoy you, he came to taste and experience your kind of kpekus and body, that's all. Nothing attached. It's not because the man is w!cked but that's how God made him. He doesn't think like you

8. WOMEN THINK OF LIFE WHEN THEY HAVE SXX
Every woman thinks that everyone life is involved during sxx. She thinks they will continue forever, with their totality.

She already submitted her life and body during sxx. 
That's why many ladies moan as if you want to k!11 them and they have surrender their life, saying, 
"yeh you want to k!11 me, 
yeh just k!11 me, oh don't stop, 
k!11 me, I love you baby"

9. WOMEN THINK OF ENERGY AND POWER RELEASED IS WORTH TO BE SERIOUSLY INVOLVED 
Men don't see what they release as anything ($perm) but a woman won't forget easily about a man that makes her cum. She feels it's power and energy that is released and prefer him above others. She loves that moment when she releases it.

 For those of you that are married, if you don't make your wife to cum, your marriage is sitting on gvn powder, the day another man makes you wife to cum, you are gone forever. She will prefer the man above you.
IN CASE YOU WANT TO BE THOUGHT HOW TO MAKE YOUR WIFE CUM, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DM ME. (ONLY MARRIED MEN PLS)

10. WOMEN KNEW A CHILD COULD COME OUT OF SXX 
A man doesn't think of baby, he just want to release it. Women worry more about given birth to a child than men

They thought that if you don't want a child, you wouldn't want sxx, so they think beyond sxx or fun, they think both of you are trying to make baby, since you promised that you loved her.

Men always mean I love you for sxx not to settle down with you. 
- It's like how you love your chicken, it's for their flesh, and not to settle with them for life. When its time to k!11 the chicken, you won't remember how you cared for it. The food you give is to produce big flesh. 
Same way that a man buys you stuff, just to have sxx and nothing more.

REMEMBER:
 Pre-marital sxx is rampant everywhere especially in the younger generation, Sxx is a part of their exploration of happiness with the opposite sxx.

* The generation that use sxx as a birthday gift to a man that is not their husbands.
* They open their leg to get anything material, iPhone, hair, food, clothing, house rent, electronics etc and money. 
* There are many single mothers who experience sxx without Love....
Then later on, they will realize the bad effects and result of being impregnated by just any man.....
* It's one of the reasons why genuine love is scares in this generation. We have given love a different meaning. 
- A person that never loved her spouse, yet complaining that he doesn't care or love enough, that's like using him.

I advice all our young generation to put Sxx as a Sacred Acts of Marriage 
And not in a way of amusement...
