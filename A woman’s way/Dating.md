Dating after children, and after two failed attempts at life partnership, is… different.

It’s as if I am playing a different game. There’s no longer a thirst or hunger for Disney romance. Even the idea of “the one” now seems kind of ridiculous. It’s like an artifact from a time I no longer belong to. And yet…

The allure still tugs at me sometimes. I can still feel that intoxicating pull into new connection, the rush of presence, the high of possibility. It’s delicious. And also, kind of boring.

There’s a grounded current available in me now that wasn’t there before. One that knows, deeply, truly, that love is not a feeling. It’s not a fantasy. It’s time. And experience. And consistent investment.

But there are also moments when I wonder… am I more sane now, or just jaded? I’m not sure. But something is different.

This season of dating is more nuanced. Introspective. I still get swept sometimes into lustful highs and future fantasies. But I return quicker now. I am not building homes on clouds anymore. I know better.

And I’m curious how others hold this.

I’ve seen people on here go through multiple marriages. I recently saw someone I’ve watched divorce twice now proclaim —with full conviction— that their third partner is the one. Their forever. Their soulmate and true love.

And I felt something in me go… really?

How do we keep saying this to ourselves with a straight face?
How do we keep selling each other this story?
Is the illusion really that seductive?

For me, after two heartbreaks I really thought would be life partnerships, I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to make that kind of public claim again.

It’s not because I don’t believe in long love. I do. I believe in devotion, in deep companionship, in the mystery that keeps some couples walking side by side for life.

But in my own personal integrity, I can’t say it before it’s true anymore. I can’t pretend to know.

And I guess one of the questions for me in this whole debacle is: why do we feel we need to know? Why does lifelong commitment, or calling someone the one, seem to validate the experience? Why do we believe that the truth of a relationship lies in how long it lasts?

Isn’t the depth, the transformation, the intimacy itself enough?

We still live in a culture that says “I’m so sorry” when a relationship ends. No matter how toxic or complete it may have been. And “I’m so happy for you” when someone announces new love. No matter how rushed or ill-fitting it may be.

There’s still this split we carry that riding solo is a space of lack, and partnership is the sign you’ve made it.

I want to challenge all of it.

The myth of completion. The illusion that permanence is proof of love. The pressure to name, define, and declare something before it’s had the time to reveal itself.

What if we stopped needing love to look a certain way to feel valid? What if we let it be what it is and let that be enough?

Recently, I had a session with Damascena an astrologer I deeply trust. And at the very end, she just briefly mentioned something about “Soul Contracts” in relationships, and it was as if just by dropping that phrase, she opened a door to a new dimension of possibility. Into something I wasn’t seeing. 

What I took away from that energetic imprint was the inquiry:
What if, instead of obsessing over how long something will last, or the degree of compatibility, we asked what the soul contract is between us?

That changed something profound in me. 

Because I’ve been wrestling with this question about the motivation of my dating now. If I’m no longer dating to find “forever,” then what am I doing? What’s the point of discernment if not to find “the one?”

But this soul contract lens has opened a new path. It’s a brilliant way to honor the meaning and medicine of each connection, without needing to make it permanent to make it real.

It’s more clear than ever for me that I am not interested in chasing forever, but in meeting what is.
Soul to soul. One contract at a time.

If I am really honest, I don’t think the point (for me) was ever forever. A truer guide for me in love has been evolution. Two souls colliding for just long enough to awaken what was sleeping, to burn away what wasn’t true and to remember what love really is.

And then, to let go -or to stay- from a place of knowing, not needing.

But I’m no longer dating to find “the one.” I’m dating to meet myself, again and again… through the mirror of the other.

I feel like I’ve crossed some kind of threshold. One many people cross but few talk about. Where love becomes less about the fairy tale, and more about the wisdom of the heart. And from this place, I’m not looking to be rescued. I’m listening for resonance.

I date not to possess or predict. But to listen. To feel into the deeper threads that brought us together. To let the relationship shape me in the ways my heart is ready for.

Love is my willingness to be changed by each meeting. It’s my devotion to truth more than fantasy. And a trust in the timing of everything we can’t control.

Maybe this piece will be a kind of deflation for some. And I get it.

I work in the field of intimacy and relationship. I know the power of hope, the pull of the fairytale. I see my peers selling programs that promise to help you call in your soul partnership. I see the traction those offers get. People want that. We want to believe.

And yet… here I am, no longer trying to sell the illusion.

Not because I don’t believe in love. But because I believe in something truer than the fantasy. I know this perspective might challenge or confront those who are still on the ride, still dreaming of the one.

And I’m okay with that risk.
Because I want what’s real.

And I want to make space for those of us who don’t fit the traditional arc of love, marriage, and family. Whose paths wind in other directions. Whose lives don’t wrap in tidy bows. That path is every bit as valid. Every bit as sacred. Every bit as worthy of being lived out loud.

***** my thoughts after reading this *****
Is this what it’s like to make new friends like a new plan for dating is it possible to get security from someone besides someone you just met and that you’re hoping will be your forever person we need to get security from somewhere else

So that we can actually look at the relationship and say how to our values match how does our workflow match but here she’s saying how does this person mirror me? I think that means like what what me shows up here what me shows up here so then you’re not looking at the other person you’re just saying what me shows up here

A relationship is like a mirror who am I here right now fuck
