I am so annoyed
In the general direction of
I want to be cherished to be seen. I want this part of me to be cared about and it feels like all he has for this part of me is defense so I don’t wanna share this part of me with him. I don’t trust him. I don’t really give a shit about his fucking defense. Seems like he’s mad that he doesn’t get to say no which I just wanna fucking leave like you go say no all of them knowing you wanna fucking say I don’t.
So he’s grappling with his nose with not realizing that his nose is super powerful. He’s thinking he’s not allowed to have a no, but he did have a no he had really loud. No it took over everything. It was really, really really loud. It note all over me so am I annoyed because Like I’m thinking his request for me to slow down and here is no like I definitely heard his no like I heard his nose so loud that it like actually hurt.
So that doesn’t make sense his no was really loud. His no was really effective.


I believe that he is not triggered by not being able to have a no, but he is triggered about, upsetting me with his no, so he wants me to be happy with his no and excited about it

The thing that’s weird here is like first of all when interacting with like my playful part and his triggered part so OK

But he keeps bringing it back to my no with touching girls or my know around Not playing an AR game socially and for me that’s like taking it like three magnitude like it’s not just like ignoring my no it’s like ignoring my no and continuing to do the thing in front of other people anyway it was a very amplified. I’m not just saying no I don’t want to unload the car right now or something like sort of like it seems like he is gets like a high social steaks where I’m actually freezing and crashing emotionally so this is confusing to compare the two like I feel so unseen and so grossed out and so Frustrated. 
And my heart has nowhere to go my heart HURT hurt has nowhere to go 
So I just keep my heart to myself. Yeah it’s not safe so my heart is my heart.
I could see how I could do this thing as well like if I’m frustrated that something that triggers me causes him to be upset. Let’s see how can I have understanding for him there cause I just have resentment and fucking like get the fuck away from me, get your fucking shit out of me stop fucking comparing the shit leave me the fuck alone
I’m wanting something to be further away from me and then I’m wanting to be seen in a different way
If I tried to do the Derek thing here
My tender parts feel really scared, but there’s nowhere for them to go
I believe that when I say something like that, I need to brace myself because even though it feels like a vulnerable sentence to me feels like it has nowhere to land with you like you’re gonna resent me or you’re just gonna repeat it like verbatim like you’re gonna go into reflective listening mode, which is still not interacting with you
My inner parts want to see in the moment that you care about them
It seems like you need to be seen first that you want to be seen for something like having a no and that that’s keeping you from seeing my hurt parts. Is there something keeping you from seeing my hurt parts?
I believe that that is the case that’s what I’m sensing. I understand that sounds like an assertion to you. It’s probably self protection so I can change around to say I feel scared to show my hurt parts right now. I feel scared that there’s nowhere for them to land
When I shared with you, the game, a part of me came alive. That got really hurt when you shut me down I don’t wanna hear reflective listening around that. I don’t wanna hear you just keep repeating what I say because it doesn’t feel like it impacts you it feels like you just become like Teflon and you just repeating what I’m saying
Just seems like you’re serving me up like the way that the sandwich has to be or something and I’m supposed to eat it or like it but it just feels like the punches keep coming and they’re Unknown. I’m so fucking tired of your bullshit. I’m so sick of how you’re fucking Brain thinks you’re all enlightened and at the same time you’re just as bad or worse than anybody like you actually like I sure you know these communication skills but you don’t know how to own your stuff you don’t know how to own your triggers you project them out at me like fucking crazy And then like if the tables were returned, you would make me own it. You would just keep saying, I don’t wanna hear that. Tell me how you feel. I don’t wanna hear that. Tell me how you feel and it feels really unfair to say that I have to hold all of your yelling at me because you don’t have the skill to find out how you actually feel so you forced me to own everything And then you demand that I hear you and listen to you because you’re unskilled about owning your stuff and somehow I process and hold that and I don’t wanna hang out with that I don’t wanna do that like I don’t know who the fuck you think you are, but it is not my fucking job to own everything I ever say perfectly and then also hold all the stuff you can’t own personally What the fuck the expectation is too high. Yes, I have skill to own everything I can do that I can own everything. Maybe I will keep working on that for myself. I like the idea of owning everything I like the idea of not lecturing I like the idea of not powering over but I’m also gonna have to say no to you projecting your shit on me and not owning that when you ask me six times over the course of three hours how I’m forcing you to do chores that’s you projecting on me you come up with your defensive stance of why I was doing something and every single thing that came out of you was in that defensive stance so when a person is that Defensive they own wow I can’t get around my block. Wow I’ve got some work to do here. Wow I really only have a certain vision of things. That’s what you do you own it But I’m not hearing you own shit. I’m hearing you fucking project and then be pissed off at me for not like taking care of you and your feelings while you’re projecting, what the fuck you don’t take care of me while I’m projecting.
