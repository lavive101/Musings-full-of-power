In Authentic Relating Games, a facilitator presents a structured way to explore the present, our relation to self and explore the relationship to others. 

Our gathering will include a mix of movement, interactive prompts and structured conversation. It is an opportunity to slow down and notice, more directly, the relational space between us. 

The games may have the side effects of: a feeling of connection, greater self-awareness, a sense of easy honesty, and meaningful relational moments.
