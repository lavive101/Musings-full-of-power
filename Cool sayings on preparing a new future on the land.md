THE COLLAPSE OF CAPITALISM

- Bill Mollison, co-creator of Permaculture.

1. Learn how to plant, not just a garden,
but also basic crops (corn, cassava, etc. )
and trees (fruitful, native, woody);

2. Create a bond with some land, whether it's your own
or a relative's, a project, a community garden, etc. Engage with the people who live there, go little by little looking for ways to spend more time in the countryside
that in the city, learning to plant, build,
treat organic waste and heal in nature;

3. Develop practical skills (cooking, carpentry, machinery repair, food processing,
sewing etc. ). Teach these skills to kids,
Friends and Neighbors...

4. Looking for a mutual support group, where people
They take care of each other, make basic necessity products collectively, such as natural hygiene products.
natural remedies such as syrups and herbal tinctures, food processing, such as preserved foods
and fermented.

5. Simplify your life now, freeing up more space and time. Discover everything you can do without money, walking, exercising, crafts and body arts, socializing with loved ones, gardening.

6. Break away from the logic of consuming more and more.
Opt for handmade products that last a long time,
quality, made by small producers, social enterprises and solidarity economic enterprises.
Exchanging, giving and receiving
by affective value, as opposed to financial value;

7. Swap, store, multiply and scatter native, non genetically modified seeds
for popular and family agriculture.

8. Recognize that life will be much better later!.
We're just in transition.
