Ok, so I’m more disabled than people realize. It’s all brain problems. Think of this way, the extent to which I am a genius is commensurate with the extent to which I cannot perform at basic day to day maintenance. My brain does one thing at a time. One. And most of what it does is think about shit and try to find ways to explain the shit it thought about. And while it’s doing that, which it almost always is, the one thing it can do is occupied by said task, and therefore is incapable of doing anything else. There ACTUALLY is a rather direct correlation between the genius and the lack of daily performance. I can’t do both, and I have very little control over the fact that my brain wanders to the theory one at the expense of the practical. I cannot control it.

Ok, confession. My living space doesn’t usually get to this point anymore, although it definitely, and it absolutely can if I’m not actively paying attention and trying. Like it’s really hard. How hard is it for me to clean dishes? Explain in explicit detail the nature and value of perception, and how that impacts the development of ideologies and social structures, and do the dishes. I can do it, but holy shit I have to be really paying attention. I mean ten years ago my roommate casually said something about “trash mountain” and then got quiet. I was like “do you call my room trash mountain?” She looked at me and bit her lip, and then said “I mean just the area where the desk is” lmao. Whatever. Her dog knew how to open doors and she was spiteful and constantly picked on my dog because he was brilliant, but she was smarter and a complete bitch (get it?), so the dog, she would break into my and shit on my bed in front of my dog to fuck with him.

What I was getting to is that I have had really wonderful friends throughout my life. What I don’t bring in housekeeping I make up for with a generous spirit that makes it ok for people to be vulnerable and honest. So I generally attract awesome people as long as I don’t fall in love.

Got distracted again. One of those days I guess. There have multiple occasions throughout my life, I don’t know how many, when I have caught one of my friends trying to secretly clean my car when I stopped for gas.

Omg one time lol. Ok, I had been homeless in this van with my alcoholic ex, and it was really bad. Like full of soda cans and empty chip bags. And there a bassist who wanted to audition to be in my band. But he didn’t have a car. So I went and I picked him up, and like it was full up to the dashboard with shit. And he opened the door, and I was like “hey, that’s my trash. Don’t lose my trash. That’s mine.” And this kid was like chasing bottles down the street nervously trying to figure out how to get in my car without losing my trash. And every time he’d manage to get all the trash picked up and put back in the car, he would open the door and more trash would fall out. I filmed it actually but I lost that phone. And I would by like “dude that’s my trash! What are you doing?” Omg I’m crying lmao I haven’t thought about this in so long. 😂🤣🤣 Anyway, he ended up climbing through the window. He didn’t make it into the band. He played bass like it was a guitar. We needed a backdrop with some groove. Not guitar 2.0.  A truly great bassist knows how to anchor the spirit of the thing with calculated simplicity. It’s the cake, not the glitter.

“Don’t lose my trash. That’s my trash. What are you doing. Put it back.” Fuck 🤣 that year and the next like four or five were best years of my entire life. It’s the only time I can think of when I was experiencing real beauty. The things in life that make it feel worth it. Friendship. Art. Celebration. Food. Dancing. Music. Laughter. Hugs. Talking under the stars. It’s been so long since I was alive.

In going back to North Carolina. I decided last night. I’m not ok and I need to go home. Coming here was a mistake. But the two years weren’t wasted. Because in those two years I found you. My people.

This is a long and random comment. And yet, many of you will read it. Because you care about me enough to want to be with me, and you value my contribution enough to want to hear me and know me.

I can’t even imagine how good my life might be once I’m back in the forests of North Cackalacky, with you in my pocket. I can already feel the air on my face. The air is so different there. Is Warmer and heavier. A pressure the feels… it feels like you’re held together by it. For me at least. Home.
