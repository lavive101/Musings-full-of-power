Hey love,

There’s something I want to try to explain—not to push you, but because I care about us, and I feel something here that’s keeping us from deeper connection.

When I come to you with something I'm trying to understanding between us,  I’ve noticed a pattern in how you respond that makes it really hard for me to feel met.

You often say things like:

• “I already told you how much I care about you.”

• “I explained that matters to me.”

• “I told you how much I want to dedicate myself to this.”

And I know you’re trying to reassure me. I know you’re saying, “This matters to me, I’ve shown up, I care.” I believe that.

But the way those statements land for me isn’t actually reassuring. It feels more like closure—like you’re trying to move past the moment instead of staying in it with me.

Here’s why it’s hard:

When you say, “I already said that,” it centers your memory of the effort you’ve made, not my emotional experience right now. It makes it feel like there’s no room for me to still be hurt, confused, or unsure—because you think we already covered it.

I end up feeling like I’m being difficult, or like something is wrong with me for still having feelings. And honestly, that hurts—because I’m not trying to rehash the past. I’m trying to connect with you now.

When you use “you statements” in those moments—like “you’re upset because…” or “you think I mean…”—it puts me in a box. I feel interpreted instead of understood. It’s like you’re telling me what my experience is instead of asking or wondering.

What I’m really asking for in those moments is presence. I want to feel like we’re in it together, not that you’re reporting from the outside or trying to prove a point.

It would mean so much to me if you could practice responding from your own internal experience instead of narrating mine. That might sound like:

• “I feel confused right now—can we slow down?”

• “I’m scared I messed up. What do you need from me right now?”

• “I want to understand what’s still hurting—can you help me see?”

That kind of language helps me feel like we’re on the same side. Like you’re actually with me in the moment. It builds trust.

I’m not asking you to say everything perfectly. I’m asking for something that feels deeper than that—your presence, your curiosity, your willingness to stay open when things get messy.

I know you care. I know this isn’t easy.

And I know you have your own patterns that protect you when things feel hard—just like I do.

But I also believe we can grow past those patterns, if we name them and stay with the discomfort.

That’s what I want. I want more of you. And more of us

With love,
