I love how there is something exciting about your comment. Like it is purely from you. No apologies and no attacks. (Here, here! The Beauty of a well crafted opinion, well done!) 

I must admit, I wildly agree with what you are saying here. I hate negative writing. Tell me what you think! Not how bad other people are. Speak from yourself, for yourself. Tell me what you want me to know without bashing others. 
Thank you for your support illuminating expression. I’m so jealous you practice writing so freely. I’m new to coming out as autistic so my masks keep me from knowing myself. But someday it will all come out and I’ll write like this. My enjoyment of your neurodiversity and your writing is making me feel a little more ok to let my autistic self out into the world. I am a pilgrim walking on the path towards self expression. Glad to know you comrade.


I am enjoying your smartness. There is substance in your words. I’m in the process of coming out to myself that I am … something like auDHD/gifted/internalized pda wrapped up in a tiny “I’ll do everything myself” body. Ahhhh a lifetime of masking. 
But the main point is realizing I have different internalized social rules than other people. Or the mainstream? Whatever the name. 
Like I can talk about you and appreciate you and have my own limerance about the whole thing. While also have a deep awareness that most of that is a pleasant fantasy in my head. (I actually just mean an idea interaction kind of limerance) 
But all that really matters is my internal story of the world. And how to explain and shape and learn about what I think and believe. 
I am a philosopher. I hide. Heavy cloaking. I am in burnout. Furious and overwhelmed by years of gaslighting and abusive situations. Where I was blamed instead of seen. 
So I can share thoughts and they are my thoughts. They could go somewhere big or go nowhere at all but from here. 
It’s like “being relational” and you are a soul in the stream of souls who could maybe understand something I’m saying. Or at least be very amusing in response and expression. For as long as it is interesting to both of us. 
I have a feeling that I am discussing a phenomena that most people don’t speak directly about. 
I love talking about it and trying to understand how the world works. Lol. 
So, I have not digested everything you said. But I did have a couple of interesting thought/feeling days while pondering things you have expressed around nihilism. (Woah! The concept brings me right to the present. Nothing matters except this glorious intense wild “right now!” But can you really feel it. It’s infinite and silent at the same time. It’s right here and forgotten. Consciousness. You were speaking about consciousness. It all exists right here now. And the biggest director of flow
