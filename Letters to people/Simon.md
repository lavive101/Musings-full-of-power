I think we both have a high need for safety. When I read this list, I realize that you are asking me to stay regulated. There is no way around the fact that I will become disregulated. (I believe this is true for all people but people of privilege can pretend it’s not because when they get disregulated, they automatically win. For example, anger in men is acceptable.)

  

Playing the role of your mom does not mean that I can just hold all feelings all the time and just “be there for you” it’s a fantasy and no mother can do that. 

  

All of the examples you used in your email are examples of one or both is us being disregulated. So what we are fighting for right now is who is “allowed to be disregulated.” 

I believe you do have some extra care from me becuase your brain is younger, less developed. I believe it is an important part of being your mom to hold your disregulation. 

But I need a way to take care of myself too. And I believe that you would not argue with that. 

So as we find our way together, we need to find a language so that our attachment system can heal. While also acknowledging that I need space to be disregulated. Or to take care of my disregulation. That means I have to move away sometimes. I

Think this could

Be hard for you because of the need for solid safe “other” to hold you. It’s a biological need. I know yours got really hurt. I watched it all happen. I could not figure out how to be the 3-4 people you needed around you to be safe and well. I believe your nervous system is so sensitive that you need safe others to help you co-regulate. I believe you use anger to demand this because your need is so great. 

I want to be able to help you. But due to the disregulation between us, I know this is also very hard. 

You need me. And I have a hard time being stable because I’m just learning to notice how sensitive I am. I am learning to set boundaries so I don’t get wildly disregulated. 

In the past, I didn’t know what to do with my disregulation. I did not take care of myself.  I tried so hard but I never knew that the reason I was failing was because I wasn’t taking care of myself.  But there is no structure to help me to know how to care for my nervous system. Especially without the knowledge of the existence of autism and having all of the other (autistic) adults in our family system being under some kind of fantasy that everything was all my fault. (That can never be the construct of actual reality that the problems in a family system is one person’s fault.) 

But if fault and punishment are part of a system, there will always be a loser. I have been on the losing team for a really long time.  

Probably like you and your trans ness. On the bottom some how of culture. Blamed more for things. Have to watch out etc. becuase the danger is real. 

  

So where does that leave you. What I think you need right now are really safe places. And I can be more safe for you if I don’t yell or talk about people that scare me in the family or - just any disregulation. I think you are wanting me to hold my disregulation. 

  

So that’s what I have been trying to figure out how to do. And the problem is that I have to leave you to do it. 

The only way to work up to this slowly would be something like accepting Schappet (Jimmy) as a step dad. Then I can stay with you and he can regulate me or you - he will choose who he feels he needs to protect and he will choose you if you need help. Meaning, he will stay calm and ask you how you are. And not abandon you when I need to take care of myself. 

It takes more than two people sometimes.
