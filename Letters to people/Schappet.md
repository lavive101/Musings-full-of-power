  “I’ve decided my mission in this relationship is to help her feel safe. In whatever way safety feels for her.
She rewards me with feelings, enthusiasm, love, openness, support, cheerfulness. 

Hey love,

I’ve been sitting with what happened at the event, and I want to share something that feels really tender and important to me.~~~~

When we talked about the game ahead of time, I said it didn’t feel okay for me—and I meant it. But I didn’t fully grasp how serious that “no” was until I experienced it in real time. I think I hoped I could just go with the flow, but my body told me otherwise. I had to leave the space, and I couldn’t calm down enough to return.

This isn’t about blame. I understand that it wasn’t intentional, and I see that we both had assumptions about who would follow up to change it. But what ended up happening is that we facilitated an event where I couldn’t participate. That hurt. It made me feel invisible in a space I co-created—and one that I deeply care about.

I’m learning to honor my limits, especially when they go against my tendency to adapt or keep the peace. This moment showed me that I can’t override myself, and I don’t want to.

What I do want is to be able to trust that when I bring something up as a no-go—especially in advance—it’s taken seriously and responded to with care. I’m asking for us to co-hold those decisions, not just so we avoid pain, but so we build the kind of partnership I know we both want: one that’s responsive, co-creative, and deeply respectful of each other’s boundaries.

I know you don’t want to hurt me. And I also know that defensiveness makes it hard to feel supported or seen. What I’m needing now is some reflection from you—some sense that you hear me, and a willingness to name how you want to show up around this in the future.

I’m here for that conversation when you’re ready. I want us to grow through this.

  

With care,

[Your name]
