There is a veil between us. Of unspeakable things. Intimacy. The Right use of power (attachment struggle kind of power). 

(And our closeness to ) The place where no blame can exist. (And so far at the same time.) 

The dirty side of consciousness that they donâ€™t tell you. Reality is a fever dream of manifested consciousness placed in a world I can only see from my perspective. What if I could see more if I thought it all is rightful. Every dark turn.
