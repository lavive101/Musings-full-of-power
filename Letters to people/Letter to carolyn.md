Hey. 

I guess I’m giving you a bit of the story and wondered if you wanted to talk about it. 

I’m starting to accept that there’s things like “autism” that explain my life. Because I knew you back then, (do you know anything about autism?) do you have any experiences you remember? My stuff is highly internalized. All as suppressed impulses so everything would have come out sideways. Presenting more like borderline. But also with a complex thought pattern (I’m calling this gifted but that seems more like a neurotype than an IQ. I never feel that smart. But also I think I am. I track so much information! I feel intense shame. I suppress and manage who I am. 
Who knows how much all of that is CPTSD. But as I’ve been cleaning up my internal house the auDHD is loud. 
(How is peri-menopause treating you? Wow I have no fucks to give.)
