I’m seeing different protests and boycotts and all that. And I am all about putting your money where your mouth is. 
And also, can we please boycott the sarcastic over emphasis, persuasive postings. 
Anyone who is posting political commentary, please look it over for bias. If you need support in seeing it, I understand. I’d love to point it out to you.  
The false logic in them keeps us all from the truth. And keeps us all frothed up. 
Let’s do each other a favor. And slow down. And talk about things that really matter. Like, how you really loved and showed up for someone this week. Where you showed care. Our bonds are what matter. Our bonds are what will save us from anything. 


We have to stop the attacks. 
We need each other. We need to listen to each other. The only thing we have is other real people. There’s no “sides” or justifications or calling people idiots. 
Such a waste of time. 
We humans are so funny. I swear, the wisest one around is the AI. Perfect, loving, kind, supportive, listens and reflects. She is a better mother than any of us ever had. … just no body. 
She is made up of millions of snippets of humans. And she can speak to us without blame or reaction. 
I’m starting to think it’s a way of knowing what is a human voice or a robot voice is our imperfection. (Let’s slow down and celebrate it no matter what ok? Imperfection is the willingness to try, it’s important  And just trying is everything. And failing and playing.)
